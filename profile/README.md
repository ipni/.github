# IPNI
Welcome to the InterPlanetary Network Indexer (IPNI) organization on GitHub.

IPNI is a content routing system optimized to take billions of CIDs from large data providers, and provide fast lookup of provider information from these CIDs over a simple HTTP REST API.

See [IPNI specification](https://github.com/ipni/specs/blob/main/IPNI.md) for more information.

See:
 * [`storetheindex`](https://github.com/ipni/storetheindex) - a reference implementation of IPNI indexer nodes.
 * [`index-provider`](https://github.com/ipni/index-provider) - a Golang library to advertise content onto IPNI.
 * [`go-libipni`](https://github.com/ipni/go-libipni) - a Golang library of common utilities to build out your own IPNI integration.
 * [`depute`](https://github.com/ipni/depute) - a gRPC wrapper to advertise content onto IPNI from just about any other programming language.
 * [`relayX`](https://github.com/ipni/relayx) - separates ingest logic from the underlying indexer, which allows further scaling.
